# An Ontological Representation of the Quantum Cascade Laser Properties
## Introduction
* We propose an ontological representation of the quantum cascade case laser properties.
We use sample properties mined from scientific articles from our prevoius work to instantiate the ontological representation in order to validate its usage[[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42941-5_34).
* The ontological representation is based an extension of the MDO ontology [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-62466-8_14).
