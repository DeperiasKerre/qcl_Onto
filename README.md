## An Ontological Representation of Properties in the Quantum Cascade Laser Domain
### Introduction
* We propose an ontological representation of heterostructure and optoelectronic characteristics in the quantum cascade laser domain. The sample data utilized as a use case to valiadate the usage of the ontology was mined from scientific articles using a pipeline developed in [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42941-5_34).
### Documentation
The documentation of the ontology can be found at this URL: TBD
